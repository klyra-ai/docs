## Introduction

AI Faceswap lets you replace the face in one image with the face from another image using advanced face-matching and blending algorithms. It is ideal for creative projects, mockups, and controlled media experiments when you have explicit permission to use both images. The tool prioritizes realism while offering controls that help you get clean, natural results.
