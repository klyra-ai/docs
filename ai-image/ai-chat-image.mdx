## Introduction

The **AI Chat Image** tool combines the power of conversational AI with advanced image generation. Instead of switching between editors and chatbots, you can **stay inside a chat interface** and simply describe the image you want.

Whether you’re designing visuals for social media, creating mockups, or experimenting with creative ideas, AI Chat Image lets you generate, refine, and save images seamlessly in a chat-first workflow.

## How to Use

  <Step title="Save and export">

  </Step>

### Tips

- **Be descriptive:** The more detail you provide in your prompt, the closer the output will match your vision.
- **Iterate quickly:** If the first result isn’t perfect, adjust your description (e.g., style, lighting, mood).
- **Mix creativity & precision:** Combine specific instructions (_“realistic portrait”_) with creative flair (_“in watercolor style”_).
- **Save variations:** Use exports to track multiple creative directions in a single conversation.

### 📌 Example Use Cases

- **Social Media:** Generate scroll-stopping content directly from a chat.
- **Product Mockups:** Quickly test product placement in different environments.
