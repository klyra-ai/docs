## Introduction

The **AI Vision** tool in Klyra AI allows you to interact with your images in a completely new way. By combining advanced computer vision with conversational AI, you can upload an image and **ask natural-language questions** about it.

Whether you need to identify objects, analyze visual patterns, extract semantic meaning, or simply describe what’s happening in an image, AI Vision provides fast, accurate results. All interactions are **saved automatically** and can be exported for reference.

## How to Use

### Navigation

**Dashboard → Left Panel → AI Images & Editing → AI Vision**

This opens the **AI Vision workspace** in the main area.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload your image">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an AI Model">
    - Choose from the list of **AI Vision models** available in your subscription.
    - Different models may have unique strengths (e.g., object recognition, contextual understanding).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your prompt">

### 💡 Tips

- Use **specific prompts** to get precise answers. For example, instead of _“What do you see?”_ ask _“What type of car is in this image?”_
- For complex analysis, break your query into multiple smaller prompts.
- Combine AI Vision with **Knowledge Retrieval** (via custom assistants) to link visual insights with your own files or data.
- Export conversations regularly to build a **visual insights library** for your projects.
