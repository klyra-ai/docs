## 🌟 Model Examples & Test Prompts

Here are tested prompts and settings you can try to explore the strengths of each model:

### 🔹 Midjourney – Cinematic & Artistic

**Prompt:** _“A futuristic city skyline at night, glowing neon lights, cyberpunk aesthetic, flying cars, rain-soaked streets, cinematic wide shot.”_\
**Parameters:** Style = Cinematic, Lighting = Dramatic, Medium = Digital Art, Mood = Dark/Colorful

👉 **Best for:** Concept art, cinematic visuals, and imaginative worlds.

<Warning>
  **Note on Midjourney Outputs**\
  Unlike other models, Midjourney generates a **grid of 4 sub-images (variants)** inside a single image file:

  - If you select **1 image**, you’ll receive **1 grid containing 4 variants**.
  - If you select **2 images**, you’ll receive **2 grids containing a total of 8 variants**.
  - Each grid has a **higher resolution** since it combines the resolution of all 4 sub-images.

  This makes Midjourney especially useful for **creative exploration**, as you get multiple variations of your prompt in a single generation.

### 💡 Tips

- **Iterate:** Start with 1 image to refine your prompt/settings, then generate more.
- **Match aspect ratio to platform:** Square for Instagram, Portrait for Stories, Landscape for banners.
- **Use Mood \+ Lighting together:** “Cheerful \+ Warm” gives a very different vibe than “Dark \+ Dramatic.”
- **Save variations:** Use the View option to compare results across different parameter sets.
- **Credits:** Each generation consumes **Media Credits** from your subscription.
