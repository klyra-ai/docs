  </Step>
  <Step title="Embed on Your Website">
    - Copy the **embed code snippet** provided after creation/training.
    - Paste it **just before** `</body>` in your website’s HTML.
    - Publish/deploy your site. The chatbot widget appears automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor & Improve">
    - **View Recent Conversations** to inspect sessions.
    - Identify unanswered or low-confidence queries → add content (Text/Q&A/PDF/URL) → retrain.
    - Iterate instructions (tone, escalation paths, boundaries) to boost quality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 💡 Tips

- **Start narrow, expand later:** Launch with core FAQs \+ pricing \+ product docs; add niche content as you learn.
- **Use a clear role & policy:** In _Chatbot Instructions_, define purpose, tone, do/don’t, escalation (“handoff to contact form/email”).
- **Turn on “Restrict to data source”** for accuracy in regulated or sensitive contexts.
- **Name sources clearly:** Easier maintenance when content grows (e.g., “Docs—Pricing.pdf”, “KB—Returns URL Crawl”).
- **Brand carefully:** High contrast text colors; keep bubble/greeting short.
- **Test before embedding:** Use preview to try real customer questions; refine fallback and links.
- **Analyze conversations weekly:** Feed gaps back into training.
- **Performance & cost:** Choose models that match budget/latency needs; cache answers to common FAQs in your content.

> ⚠️ **Responsible Use:** Don’t upload confidential data you’re not authorized to share. Ensure your privacy policy discloses chatbot use and data handling. For PII or regulated content, keep **Restrict to data source** on and review logs regularly.
