### ðŸ’¡ Tips

- **Keep scripts natural:** Write text the way youâ€™d like it spoken â€” short sentences, conversational tone.
- **Use SSML effects:** Add pauses (`<break time="1s"/>`), emphasis, or speed adjustments to fine-tune delivery (AWS & GCP supported).
- **Preview before full synthesis:** Helpful to check if a voice matches your project tone.
- **Format wisely:** Use **MP3** for web/podcasts, **WAV** for studio-quality editing.
