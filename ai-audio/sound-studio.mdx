## üé¨ Example Walkthrough

Here‚Äôs an example of how to use **Sound Studio** to merge a custom background track (from AI Music) with a narrated voiceover (from AI Voiceover).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Background Music (AI Music ‚Äì Stable Audio)">
    - **Title:** _World Falls Silent_
    - **Model Used:** Stable Audio (47 seconds)
    - **Prompt:**

      > _‚ÄúA dark, cinematic soundtrack with low drones and subtle pulses at the beginning, evoking mystery and unease. Soft, atmospheric synths layered with distant metallic echoes and deep rumbling bass build a sense of suspense. Around the midpoint, add tense strings and muted percussion to raise urgency, mimicking the sound of hearts racing. Toward the end, let the rhythm slow and dissolve into an eerie, fading soundscape, leaving only echoes and silence ‚Äî a haunting cliff-hanger finish suitable for narration.‚Äù_

    This generated a **haunting cinematic score** ‚Äî ideal for storytelling narration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate Voiceover (AI Voiceover)">
    - **Title:** _When the World Falls Silent_
    - **Script:**

      > _‚ÄúIn the silence of the night‚Ä¶ a voice rises from the shadows. Low. Urgent. A warning‚Ä¶ no one was meant to hear. They said the world would end quietly. But endings‚Ä¶ are never quiet. They come with fire. With fear. With the sound of hearts racing in the dark. On the third night‚Ä¶ at twelve forty-five‚Ä¶ the message returned. Numbers etched in static. A path through ruin. A truth buried too deep to stay hidden. Across broken cities‚Ä¶ through empty roads and endless silence‚Ä¶ we followed the signal. Each step heavier than the last. Each breath‚Ä¶ closer to the answer. And then‚Ä¶ we found it. The reason. The revelation. The beginning‚Ä¶ disguised as the end. When the world falls silent‚Ä¶ the truth will speak. And nothing‚Ä¶ will ever be the same..‚Äù_
