### Pro Tips

- Ask specific questions like “Summarize the key findings in this report” instead of broad prompts for faster, more accurate responses.
- You can ask follow-up questions without re-uploading the document—AI File Chat retains context during the session.
- For large datasets in CSV format, narrow your queries to a specific column or time range for clearer results.

### Best Practices

- Always review AI responses for accuracy before using them in decision-making.
- Avoid uploading files containing sensitive or confidential information unless you have secure processing enabled.
- Organize and name your files before upload to keep track of analysis.
