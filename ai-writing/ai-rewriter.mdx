## Introduction

AI Rewrite helps you transform drafts, blog paragraphs, product descriptions, emails, or any written content into polished variations. Choose language, tone, creativity, and point of view, then generate one or more rewritten versions that match your brand voice. The tool is ideal for content refreshes, A/B testing, and speeding up copy editing without manual rewriting.

## How to Use AI Rewriter

Follow these steps to produce improved content with AI Rewrite.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Input Language">
    Choose the language of your source text. This ensures accurate grammar and natural phrasing in the output.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste Target Text">
    In the Target Text field paste the paragraph or content block you want rewritten. Short paragraphs produce the most consistent results; for long documents, process section by section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose AI Model">
    Select the GPT model available under your subscription. Higher capacity models usually produce more fluent and context-aware rewrites.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Creativity">
    Pick a creativity profile such as Original, Creative, Repetitive, Imaginative, or Deterministic. Higher creativity yields more novel rewrites while deterministic mode keeps the output conservative.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Tone of Voice">
    Select a tone from the available list (for example Professional, Exciting, Humorous). Tone controls formality, word choice, and pacing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Point of View">
    Choose First Person, Second Person, or Third Person to match the narrative perspective you need.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Number of Results">
    Set how many alternative rewrites you want the tool to generate. The default is 1. Generating multiple variants is useful for A/B testing or picking the best phrasing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Rewrite">
    Press the Rewrite button to run the model. Processing time depends on the model and text length.
  </Step>
</Steps>
