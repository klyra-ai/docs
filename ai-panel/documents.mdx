## Introduction

The **Documents section** in the AI Panel acts as your **personal library**. Every piece of content generated across Klyra AI tools is automatically stored here for easy access.

Here’s what you’ll find:

- **All Images** — AI-generated visuals with quick actions.
- **All Voiceovers** — Text-to-speech outputs in a detailed table view.
- **All Transcripts** — Audio transcriptions with playback and export options.
- **All Codes** — Generated code snippets and scripts.
- **All Workbooks** — Custom folders for organizing content by project or purpose.

This centralized storage ensures you can **retrieve, manage, and reuse content instantly** without switching between tools.
