### üé¨ Example 1:  The Awakening Golem

**Model Selected:** Kling 1.6 Pro

Camera maintains focus on the watch's face throughout, which should reflect each environment while its hands spin increasingly faster. End with the sand blast from impact revealing the watch is actually a sophisticated time machine.
